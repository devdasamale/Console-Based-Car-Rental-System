2. **Customer Management**: Records customer information such as name, contact number, address, and PAN ID, creating a new customer record upon renting a car.
3. **Rental Process**: 
   - Displays available cars with details like brand, model, and daily rental rate.
   - Allows customers to rent a car by specifying rental days, calculates the total price, and confirms rental after customer approval.
   - Supports car return with verification to ensure proper record maintenance.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers an interactive menu with options to display available cars, rent a car, return a car, or exit the system.
  
This system serves as a straightforward yet functional solution for car rental businesses, enabling efficient management of car inventories and customer interactions through a console-based application.
